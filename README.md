# DAND_Titanic_Data_Analysis
Intro to Data Analysis - Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

Prepared for this project with: Intro to Data Analysis

## What do I need to install?
I needed an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. You can find installation instructions here.

## Why this Project?
This project will introduce to the data analysis process that I will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, I will go through the entire process so that I know how all the pieces fit together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process. In this project, I will also gain experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Why is this Important to my Career?
This project will show off a variety of data analysis skills, as well as showing potential employers that you know how to go through the entire data analysis process.

## How do I Complete this Project?
This project is connected with the Introduction to Data Analysis course, which helps complete this project.

### Introduction
For the final project, I conducted my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. I started by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. I am not be required to use statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I made it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that looking for one right answer.

### Step One - Choose Your Data Set

* Titanic Data - Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view a description of this dataset on the Kaggle website, where the data was obtained.
* Supporting Materials - titanic_data.csv

### Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually Iâ€™ll want to submit my project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). A single folder that will eventually contain:

* The report communicating my findings
* Any Python code I wrote as part of your analysis
* The data set you used

### Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Here are an idea to get you started:

* Titanic Data
: What factors made people more likely to survive?

I created questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation. I used NumPy and Pandas where they are appropriate!

### Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once I have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting. I made sure that my report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish my comments and findings from my code work.

### Step Five - Review
I used the Project Rubric to review my project.
